**CURRENT STATE OF THE PROJECT**
William: I have set up the environment and I believe it is up and running now (python manage.py runserver to run the web app). If any of you see stuff that needs
changed or fixed feel free to go ahead and do so, I am sort of learning Django and API stuff on the fly for this project.

William: To run the server you have to use the command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

**THINGS LEFT TO STILL ADD**
1. Make sure front end looks good and consistent
2. Implement music recommendation advanced function (overall and per playlist)
3. Clean up music data analytics function?
4. Make sure that the flow of the we app is working properly (ie. not getting stuck with the wrong account, making sure the appropriate pages can get back to the home screen, etc...)

To get codespaces set up:
1. Create a codespace on main
2. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tunetrack.git
cd tunetrack

3. Create a virtual environment and activate your venv:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Upgrade pip:
pip install --upgrade pip

5. Create the .env file
cp .env.example .env
(This should just create it but if not create a file named .env and copy over the contents from .env.example)

6. Install dependancies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Apply database migrations:
python manage.py migrate

8. Run the server:
python manage.py runserver

(I'm pretty sure this is right not positive)

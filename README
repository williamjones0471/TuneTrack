**CURRENT STATE OF THE PROJECT**
William: I have set up the environment and I believe it is up and running now (python manage.py runserver to run the web app). If any of you see stuff that needs
changed or fixed feel free to go ahead and do so, I am sort of learning Django and API stuff on the fly for this project.
